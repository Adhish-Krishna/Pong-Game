# Pong Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game built using Python and the Pygame module. It includes two paddles, a ball, and basic collision detection. I did this when I was in my 12th grade.

## Features
- **Single-player mode**: Each player controls one paddle.
- **Simple AI mode**: The opponent is played by the computer.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of player scores.
